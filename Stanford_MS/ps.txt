I am completing a dual degree in mechanical engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and computer science at the University of Michigan. My earlier schooling trained me to work steadily toward clear, exam-based goals; in college, navigating two universities with different expectations around independent study, class participation, and office hours showed me that effort alone is not enough. I was initially focused on meeting explicit requirements—submitting projects, preparing for tests—but slower to understand how to use less visible resources such as office hours, reading groups, and informal conversations with faculty. Learning to ask for guidance in a second language and to treat syllabi as starting points rather than checklists made me aware of a “hidden curriculum”: unwritten rules that are obvious to some students and invisible to others, especially those from different academic backgrounds.

That awareness of invisible barriers also shaped how I saw my neighborhood in Shanghai, where older residents were quietly shut out of everyday services as more of them moved into smartphone apps. I helped organize a visit to a senior activity center where we sat one-on-one with older adults, walked through essential tasks on WeChat, and practiced until they could repeat the steps on their own. Many began by apologizing for being “slow,” but their tone changed once they completed a task independently. That experience showed me that digital inequality is not only about networks or hardware; it is also about design, pacing, and whether anyone is willing to sit beside a user who has been told they do not belong.

As a teaching assistant for ENGR 1000J, an introductory course where teams build web-based games, I saw a similar pattern. Teams often centered on one or two confident programmers, while less experienced or quieter students stayed away from the code. I encouraged teams to decompose projects into small features so each member owned at least one, and I asked experienced students to explain their design decisions aloud and rotate roles. I also met one-on-one with hesitant students to implement their first feature. By the end of the term, most students could point to a part of the project they had written, and several said it was the first time they felt like contributors rather than observers. Experiences like these have taught me to care not only about who is technically capable, but also about who feels able to participate.

At Stanford, I hope to contribute not only through computer-systems research but also by helping peers navigate the program with fewer hidden barriers. Studying both in Shanghai and in Ann Arbor has made me attentive to how norms around office hours, large projects, and research opportunities can exclude students who are new to systems or to this environment. Whether as a teaching assistant or as a peer, I plan to make expectations explicit, share study strategies, and help build project teams where every member owns a meaningful piece of the work so that more students can see themselves as insiders to technical communities.
