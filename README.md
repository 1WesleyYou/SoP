Five primary topics to cover in your statement of purpose:
个人陈述中需涵盖的五个主要主题：

How did you become interested in this field? Establish that you have had a long-term interest in the field and that you have taken positive steps in pursuing your interest. Give the committee members a sense of your particular talents and abilities and their relevance to your academic interests.
你是如何对这个领域产生兴趣的？证明你对该领域有长期的兴趣，并且已经采取了积极的行动去追求你的兴趣。让委员会成员了解你的特殊才能和能力及其与你的学术兴趣的相关性。
What experiences have contributed toward your preparation for further study in this field? Demonstrate your interest by providing examples of research experiences, internships, work experience, community service, publications, or life experiences. Briefly describe what you did in each experience. Also, make sure to articulate what you have learned about the field and how those lessons stimulated you to pursue an advanced degree.
哪些经历有助于你为在这个领域进行进一步学习做准备？通过提供研究经历、实习经历、工作经验、社区服务、出版物或生活经历等例子来展示你的兴趣。简要描述你在每个经历中的具体活动。同时，确保清晰地表达你对这个领域的了解，以及这些经历如何激发你追求更高学位。
What are your future goals? Specifically state your degree objective (Master's or Ph.D.) and specify what subdisciplines you are interested in pursuing. For example, if you are applying in political science, the committee needs to know whether you are pursuing American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, or Political Theory. Let the reader know that you are planning a future career as a university professor, researcher, or consultant, or in public service or private practice (or whatever your goal happens to be).
你的未来目标是什么？具体说明你的学位目标（硕士或博士），并说明你感兴趣的研究子学科。例如，如果你申请的是政治学，委员会需要知道你是否在追求美国政治、比较政治、国际关系或政治理论。让读者知道你计划未来成为一名大学教授、研究员、顾问，或在公共服务或私人执业（或你的任何目标）领域工作。
What are your research interests? Within your subdiscipline, you should be able to identify one or two topics that are of interest to you. When possible, be specific about your research agenda. Remember that you will be working with professors in research; therefore, your research interests should parallel those of the faculty. (You will usually not be expected to know exactly what you want to research; faculty know that initial interests often change.)
你的研究兴趣是什么？在你的子学科中，你应该能识别一个或两个你感兴趣的主题。在可能的情况下，具体说明你的研究计划。记住你将和教授一起进行研究；因此，你的研究兴趣应与教师的研究方向相一致。（通常不会要求你确切知道你想研究什么；教师知道初始兴趣往往会改变。）
How are you a "match" for the program to which you are applying? Explain what attracts you most to the institution/program to which you are applying. Align your research interests with those of one or more of the affiliated professors. The better the "match" with the program/professors, the better the chance that you will be admitted.
你是如何成为你所申请项目的"匹配"人选的？解释你最吸引你申请的院校/项目的方面。将你的研究兴趣与一位或多位相关教授的研究方向相匹配。与项目/教授的"匹配度"越高，你被录取的机会就越大。
Other factors to weave in (remember these are secondary factors):
其他需要融入的因素（记住这些是次要因素）：

Give examples of personal attributes or qualities that would help you complete graduate study successfully.

Describe your determination to achieve your goals, your initiative and ability to develop ideas, and your ability to work independently.

Describe background characteristics that may have placed you at an educational disadvantage (English language learner, family economic history, lack of educational opportunity, disability, etc.).
描述可能使你在教育上处于不利地位的背景特征（如英语学习者、家庭经济史、缺乏教育机会、残疾等）。
Leave the reader believing that you are prepared for advanced academic work and will be successful in graduate school.
