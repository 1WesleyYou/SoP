abstract = {Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) are significantly transforming network management practices. In this paper, we present our experience developing Confucius, a multi-agent framework for network management at Meta. We model network management workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to aid planning. Our framework integrates LLMs with existing management tools to achieve seamless operational integration, employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve long-term memory, and establishes a set of primitives to systematically support human/model interaction. To ensure the accuracy of critical network operations, Confucius closely integrates with existing network validation methods and incorporates its own validation framework to prevent regressions. Remarkably, Confucius is a production-ready LLM development framework that has been operational for two years, with over 60 applications onboarded. To our knowledge, this is the first report on employing multi-agent LLMs for hyper-scale networks.},

abstract = {Cloud scale provides the vast resources necessary to replace failed components, but this is useful only if those failures can be detected. For this reason, the major availability breakdowns and performance anomalies we see in cloud environments tend to be caused by subtle underlying faults, i.e., gray failure rather than fail-stop failure. In this paper, we discuss our experiences with gray failure in production cloud-scale systems to show its broad scope and consequences. We also argue that a key feature of gray failure is differential observability: that the system's failure detectors may not notice problems even when applications are afflicted by them. This realization leads us to believe that, to best deal with them, we should focus on bridging the gap between different components' perceptions of what constitutes failure.},
