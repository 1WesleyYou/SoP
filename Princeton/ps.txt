I am completing two bachelor's degrees--Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Computer Science at the University of Michigan--and the hardest part was not workload, but switching academic cultures. My earlier schooling emphasized high-stakes exams and explicit rubrics. At Michigan, I ran into a "hidden curriculum": how to learn from open-ended reading lists, how to make use of office hours, and how to ask questions clearly in a second language. That gap became concrete in an operating systems course, where I over-focused on implementation and underestimated the exam’s emphasis on reasoning.

Rather than treating that setback as a verdict on my ability, I treated it as feedback on my approach. I began attending office hours weekly, formed a small study group to compare strategies, and built a routine of reading checkpoints and practice problems. Repeating the cycle—try, get stuck, ask early, iterate—taught me that progress in research is often social: it depends on making uncertainty discussable and turning tacit expectations into shared tools.

Outside campus, volunteering in Shanghai to help seniors use smartphones reinforced the same lesson: people learn faster when the rules are explicit and questions feel low-cost.

These experiences are a major reason I want graduate study. At Princeton, I would enrich the residential scholarly community by making entry points into academic life more visible—newcomer-friendly reading discussions, lightweight “how to read systems papers” templates, and informal peer Q&A hours that welcome early questions and help more students participate fully.
