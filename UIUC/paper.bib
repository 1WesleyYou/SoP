abstract = {Cloud scale provides the vast resources necessary to replace failed components, but this is useful only if those failures can be detected. For this reason, the major availability breakdowns and performance anomalies we see in cloud environments tend to be caused by subtle underlying faults, i.e., gray failure rather than fail-stop failure. In this paper, we discuss our experiences with gray failure in production cloud-scale systems to show its broad scope and consequences. We also argue that a key feature of gray failure is differential observability: that the system's failure detectors may not notice problems even when applications are afflicted by them. This realization leads us to believe that, to best deal with them, we should focus on bridging the gap between different components' perceptions of what constitutes failure.},

abstract = {Efficient resource allocation is essential in cloud systems to facilitate resource sharing among tenants. However, the growing scale of these optimization problems have outpaced commercial solvers commonly employed in production. To accelerate resource allocation, prior approaches either customize solutions for narrow domains or impose workload-specific assumptions. In this work, we revisit real-world resource allocation problems and uncover a common underlying structure: the vast majority of these problems are inherently separable, i.e., they optimize the aggregate utility of individual resource and demand allocations, under separate constraints for each resource and each demand. Building on this observation, we develop DEDE, a scalable and theoretically rooted optimization framework for large-scale resource allocation. At the core of DEDE is a decouple-and-decompose approach: it decouples entangled resource and demand constraints and thereby decomposes the overall optimization into alternating per-resource and per-demand subproblems that can be solved efficiently and in parallel. We have implemented and released DEDE as a Python package with a familiar modeling interface. Our experiments on three representative resource allocation tasks--cluster scheduling, traffic engineering, and load balancing--demonstrate that DEDE delivers significant speedups while generating higher-quality allocations.},
