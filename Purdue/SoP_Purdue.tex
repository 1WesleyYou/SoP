%% Why do you wish to attend graduate school? What would you like to study? Keep it broad, details come-in later
My desire to build agentic systems was inspired by my course projects experience that showed how new-generation systems could enable mass adoption of new technologies and has been further
fueled by my work at UIUC SysNet and MSR-Asia, where I explored reliability issues in large-
scale systems, such as fault-tolerance of distributed systems and correctness issues in cloud management

programs. My research has led to 30+ bug fixes in production systems and has fueled further research
[4]. Through graduate studies at University of Michigan Ann-Arbor, I hope to become a researcher who
builds scalable and reliable software systems that can handle increasingly complex and intensive data and
processing needs.



%% Describe 2-3 past projects that might be relevant to your research interests. (10-12 lines per project)

% PROJECT 1: P3 - Distributed Graph Neural Network Training at Scale


% PROJECT 2: SURGEON - Early-Exit Inference


% PROJECT 3: Graphite - Distributed Temporal Graph Processing


%% Non-research accomplishments (e.g. Grades, Academic Service, Work experience) (10-12 lines)

% Grades

% TA and Academic Service

% Industry

%% Why this school? List professors you would like to work with and why? (10-12 Lines)

%% Summary (3-4 Lines)

% Add some blank space between text and references
% \vspace{0.125in}

% References

% **NOTE**: There are better ways to manage citations in LaTeX, most notably using a bibTeX. I wanted to have greater control on how citations were spaced and formatted and therefore ended up hardcoding them here. Your mileage may wary!

% That's All Folks.

% Best of luck, you got this! :)
