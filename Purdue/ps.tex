\textbf{Personal Education History and Challenges.}
I grew up in Zhejiang, China in a family that cared more about curiosity than competition. At school, however, success was often defined almost entirely by exam scores. I did well in that system, but I also saw classmates who struggled quietly when they missed a concept early on and then felt that the door to science or engineering had closed. I often sat with them after class to go over homework step by step. Those small conversations were the first time I realized how much a little extra explanation and encouragement can change someone's sense of belonging in a technical field.

In college, I chose a path that pulled me between two different higher education systems: mechanical engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and computer science at the University of Michigan. This meant two sets of degree requirements, calendars, and advising structures. In my first two years, my schedule was packed with mandatory courses, and it was hard to reserve time for early research or to follow a standard ``CS major'' plan. I often felt behind when I compared myself with peers who could focus on one curriculum. To cope, I treated my coursework like a dependency graph, planning each term so that I could open space for systems and networking classes as soon as possible.

Moving from Shanghai to Ann Arbor added another set of challenges. I had to adjust to courses taught in English, different expectations about class participation, and norms around using office hours. At first, I misunderstood some of these norms and tried to handle everything on my own. In Advanced Operating Systems, for example, I focused almost entirely on coding the projects and did not spend enough time reading the papers or asking questions. My midterm performance was much worse than I expected. After that, I forced myself to visit office hours, admit what I did not understand, and ask the professor how they expected us to study. That experience taught me that success in this environment depends not only on effort, but also on knowing how to use resources that are not always obvious to students who did not grow up in the same system. It was my first personal encounter with what I now think of as the ``hidden curriculum'' of research universities.

\textbf{Community Engagement and the Digital Divide.}
During my time in Shanghai, I joined a university volunteer program that visited a local senior activity center. Many of the older adults there lived alone and were being pushed toward smartphone-based services for daily tasks such as paying bills, booking hospital appointments, or talking with family. For them, the phone was not a source of convenience but a reminder of how quickly the world had moved past them.

My role was simple: sit next to one person at a time, show them how to unlock the phone, open the right app, and complete a basic task, often repeating the same steps many times. Some of them apologized for being ``slow'' or said that technology was ``only for young people.'' Over time, as they learned how to send a photo to a grandchild or complete an online form without asking their children, I could see their confidence grow. These sessions were small and individual, but they changed how I think about technology and fairness. I realized that the digital divide is not only about network coverage or hardware: it is also about design choices, patience, and whether someone is willing to sit beside you while you learn.

\textbf{Mentoring and Inclusive Teaching.}
At Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I later became a teaching assistant for ENGR~1000J, an introductory course where first-year students build a small web-based game in teams. Many students had never programmed before, while a few already had substantial experience. In early project meetings, I noticed that the confident students naturally took on the ``core'' coding tasks, while others were pushed toward communication or documentation roles. Some students, especially those who were quieter or less confident in their English, barely touched the code at all and started to see themselves as ``non-technical.''

As a TA, I tried to change this dynamic in small, concrete ways. When I met with teams, I encouraged them to break the project into smaller features and to let each member own at least one piece of functionality, no matter how simple. I asked more experienced students to explain their design decisions out loud and rotate roles. For students who were hesitant to write code, I sat with them one-on-one to implement their first feature, line by line, until they felt comfortable pushing a change. By the end of the term, almost every student had something in the project they could point to and say, ``I built that.'' For me, the most meaningful feedback was when students who had doubted their abilities told me that this was the first time they felt included in a technical project rather than just observing it from the edge.

These experiences, as a student and as a TA, have shaped how I see education and community. I have been lucky to study in strong institutions in both China and the United States, but I have also seen how easy it is for capable people to be left out because they do not yet know the unwritten rules or do not see themselves reflected in the most confident voices in the room.

\textbf{Future Contributions at Purdue.}
At Purdue, I hope to contribute not only as a researcher in computer systems, but also as someone who helps others navigate demanding environments. Drawing on my experience moving between two university systems, I plan to \textbf{serve as a teaching assistant} who makes expectations explicit and shares the ``hidden curriculum'' around office hours, large projects, and finding research opportunities, so that students who are new to systems, to computer science, or to the U.S.\ academic system do not have to figure everything out alone. I also hope to take part in cross-cultural student communities and to help build project teams where differences in language, culture, and background are treated as strengths rather than barriers. By continuing to challenge myself in advanced coursework and research---and being honest about the struggles behind each step---I want to help create an environment where students from many backgrounds can persist, ask for help without shame, and feel that they truly belong at Purdue.
